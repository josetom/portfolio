I have been thinking about writing a blog for quite some time now and never really found the mind space to write.
This is my first attempt at writing a blog and I will share my experiences founding a startup (Failed at it, but learned a lot)

[Beecon Fleet Management](https://www.beecon.in) taught me a lot of things. From bootstrapping a company to a fairly good revenue,
to struggling under the effects of demonitisation and taking strong decisions. Logistics was undergoing a disruption

## Genesis

Back in 2016, when I used to work at [Citi](https://www.citi.com/) for their FX Product [CitiFXPulse](https://citifxpulse.com)
spending 12-14 hours a day used to be a very common occurrence. I joined as a fresher there and programming fascinated me.
In college I had barely done any programming and I learned basic Java and Javascript at Citi.

It was around this time, couple of my friends and I discussed about doing something on our own. We started with some ideas around pets,
then researched a bunch of other ideas before finalizing on an idea about unifying the fragmented Logistics market in India.

## The product

We envisioned a product that would let a fleet owner manage their day to day operations, finances, customer management etc.
As part of it, we first built an ERP solution to manage fleets, drivers, revenue etc. Quickly we realised, our biggest competitor is
Excel sheet. The fleet owners were mostly running the business for a while and are not tech savvy. With this, using a new tool
and not having people well versed with computer to manage the operations became another challenge.

In order to make people move out of Excel sheet and use our app, we had to find something else that adds value to them.
A big challenge that time was not knowing where their vehicles are. So we built integrations with multiple GPS devices and started
providing fleet monitoring as a service. This started getting us the first few customers.

Over time, we introduced further integrations like Fuel theft monitoring, geofencing, live video streaming etc. These boosted our product significantly,
and we started getting customers through some strategic partnerships.

## Delay in defining MVP and product market fit

As you can imagine, adding all these features took us some time. We had bootstrapped the company and was surviving on whatever we had saved
during our 2 year stint at Citi. It took us close to 1 year or slightly more to have our MVP created and get the first couple of customers.
Also, another challenge was every prospect that we were going to had different and very varied set of requirements from what we were planning to build.
Given our desperation to get customers, we went ahead and added every feature that the customers asked for.

## Cash rotation in Logistics business and lack of cashflow

There was another challenge that awaited us even after building the feature capabilities.
Logistics business in India runs on cash rotation and none of our customers were paying us for the service.
Often we were not even getting paid for the GPS devices that we had installed in their trucks.
This was making us run in extremely tight cashflow situations.

We were having Rs.5 tea, Rs.40 meal and were on a very tight budget. All of us cramped up in an apartment and couple of our friends
who were sharing the apartment with us were fronting us with the rent payment. I am sure, I can never imagine going back to this level of frugality ever.

## Impact of Demonitisation

Somehow amidst all these challenges we were continuing with our startup. However, the big blows started coming when some of our biggest customers had started
taking a hit due to demonitisation, introduction of GST, e-way bill etc and their business models had to change. This made them cancel our deals and resulted
us in having unsold inventory of devices and not receiving our payables either.

Our competitors at that time who had funding like [locus.sh](https://locus.sh/), [Blackbuck](https://blackbuck.com/index.php), etc. were able to focus
on to a subset of the problem and could continue surviving in the market during these times.

## Lack of Investment and advisors

Even amidst all this, we founders wanted to continue with the idea of bootstrapping and didn't go behind investments.
We had a couple of discussions with some investors, but that didn't go well either since we weren't generating much revenue at that time.

Our customer aquisition and strategy was fully organic and completely based on our understanding of market and learning from interactions with customers.
We didn't focus on getting experienced people in the domain as advisors and this heavily affected our decision making and judgement.

## Personal challenges

Somewhere amidst all this, life was also taking hard U-turns on some of us as we had been failing in business and families started asking questions.
As usual, Indian parents are always worried about their educated kids not making any salary and doing something that they don't understand.
Also, having girl friends meant that they are getting pressure to get married and finally I had to cave in to these pressures and then decide to leave my company.

## Decision to leave

It was not an easy decision to make and had a difficult time coping up with this and was almost in depression since I was feeling I have failed,
and also felt I was making the other 2 people who trusted in me also fail.

Between the 3 of us founders, we didn't have a partnership agreement in case of one founder leaving.
Since, I was feeling sad that I was making my friends also fail, I decided to forego all my equity and left the company.
At this point of time, I really had to start making some money to settle my debts and start looking at getting my personal life back on track.

I then went and joined [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/), a reasonably successful startup that time about to get into the next phase.
(More about that will be written in my next blog)

Eventually, in another few months, the other 2 founders also decided to call it time and the company was aquired with them joining the company that aquired.

## Lessons learned

### Right co-founders

It is very important to choose the right co-founders. The founders should have complementary skillset.
eg. if you are a tech founder, find someone who believes in the idea, but good at sales or so.
All techies likely means you will miss out on sales, or clearly defining product market fit, etc.
As techies, you will never be fully satisfied with what you build because you always know that you can do better.

### Advisors

Get advisors at the right time and ensure that there are people to guide you.
Often as young blood wanting to do a lot of things, you may think you know everything or you can learn it all, but that hardly is the case.
You need people to guide you. The experience and know how the advisors are able to bring into the table can solve problems that otherwise would take you much longer.

### Investment

Get investment at the right time if you are in a cash tight business. There is no glory in bootstrapping and losing all your money.
99% of the cases, if you can't land an investment, you are either not having the right team or product idea, unless you firmly believe you are in the other 1%.
Getting an investment is also a validation of your idea to see whether people really find value in your product.

### Identify your ICP

Identify a good pricing strategy and figure out when to pull the plug on some deals.
Customers at an early stage of your company can be very difficult to satisfy. You are building something new and there is always someone who has more capabilities.
But for you to build something, you need to have that clear vision and not deviate much.
So choose your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) and build only for them. Rest of the customers are likely going to cost you time and not much outcome.

## Footnote

This blog is purely based on my experiences. There are many founders who made it big bootstrapping, or just by having tech co-founders.
I am happy to discuss further if you feel I am wrong and my understanding has been wrong.
